Below are some resources that I have found useful related to data science:

1. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

2. [Peerj - practical data science] (https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/). This is a collection of articles that discuss best practices for data collection and analysis.
