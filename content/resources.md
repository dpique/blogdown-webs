How do I learn computational biology?
Below are some free resources that I have found useful related to data science and computational biology. These mostly pertain to the R environment

1. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). A comprehensive guide to how to do data science. Covers everything from data import to statistical modeling, visualization, and communication of results. Provides both the big picture and details through worked examples. Explains "tidyverse" principles. Only downside is there's not a focus on life sciences.

2. [Peerj - practical data science](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/). This is a collection of articles that discuss best practices for data collection and analysis.

3. Audit this series of courses: [Data science specialization on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/home/welcome)

4. Subscribe to [Monday morning data science (MMDS)](http://jhudatascience.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5ea551600fcdf84334e5aa6b0&id=26c0b7221a) - weekly newsletter with updates on R and data science news and resources

5. Take the [Stanford edX course on statistical learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about). Very comprehensive - includes videos, a free book, and R code examples.

6. Subscribe to [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) as a way to learn about new tools

7. Follow Hadley Wickham, Jeff Leek, Roger Peng on Twitter.

8. Sign up for a local hackathon. If there are none in your neighborhood, join one online. 

9. Contribute to an open-source project. Here's [a guide for how to get started](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

10. An understanding of statistics (e.g. linear models, dimensionality reduction, permutations) and linear algebra help with doing computational biology. Essential linear algebra and statistics are offered by [this course](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences). Knowing the basics of calculus is also helpful. Other statistics courses are listed above. 

11. A sequence of courses offered by Rafa Irizarry on edX in R for the life sciences
https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences
https://www.edx.org/xseries/genomics-data-analysis

12. [Cheatsheets offered by RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

13. Genomics databases available online - there's a wealth of knowledge out there. Wikipedia [has a good list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases), and [so does CSHL](https://cshl.libguides.com/c.php?g=523983&p=3582517).

14. [Pudding.cool](https://pudding.cool/) has well-illustrated and interesting data essays 

15. The [Simply statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/) blog has updates from leading academic data scientists

Resources specific to Einstein

1. [Dissertation database](http://libcat.einstein.yu.edu/search/a?searchtype=Y&searcharg=dissertations+and+theses&SORT=D&searchscope=1&submit=Search) - click on the first link. For an example of a well-organized thesis, search for Shira Rockwitz, student of Deyou Zheng, at Einstein.
