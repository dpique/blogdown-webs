Hello! Thank you for visiting my site.

My name is Daniel, and I apply and develop tools to gain insights into chronic diseases using both clinical and genetic data. I am currently an MD/PhD student at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Bronx, NY). I completed my PhD in 2018 in the Department of Systems and Computational Biology and am currently a 4th year medical student.
