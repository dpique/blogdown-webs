Hello! Thank you for visiting my site!

I develop tools to gain insights into cancer from high-throughput genomics sequencing data. I am currently an MD/PhD student at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Bronx, NY) in the Department of Systems and Computational Biology. I am interested in the application of machine learning methods to high-throughput sequencing data to identify novel oncogenes and drug targets in  cancer. I am also interested in streamlining patients' visits to medical clinics.

I majored in Genetics at the University of Georgia and graduated with a certificate in interdisciplinary writing.

I enjoy playing squash and attending hackathons.
