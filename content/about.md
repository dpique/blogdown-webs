Hello! Thank you for visiting my site.

I apply and develop tools to gain insights into human diseases using both clinical and genomic data. I am part of the <span> <a href="https://www.einstein.yu.edu/education/mstp/" target="_blank">Medical Scientist Training Program</a> </span> at the <span> <a href="https://www.einstein.yu.edu/" target="_blank">Albert Einstein College of Medicine</a> </span> (Bronx, NY). I completed my PhD in 2018 in the Department of Systems and Computational Biology and am currently a 4th year medical student.
