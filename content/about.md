Hello! Thank you for visiting my site.

My name is Daniel, and I apply and develop tools to gain insights into chronic diseases using both clinical and genetic data. I am currently an MD/PhD student at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Bronx, NY). I completed my PhD in 2018 in the Department of Systems and Computational Biology and am currently a 3rd year medical student. My career goal is to help understand, treat and prevent chronic diseases, particularly as they relate to medically underserved communities.

I also enjoy playing squash and attending hackathons.
