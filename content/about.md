Hello! Thank you for visiting my site.

I develop tools to gain insights into cancer from genomic data. I am currently an MD/PhD student at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Bronx, NY) in the Department of Systems and Computational Biology. I am interested in the application of machine learning methods to high-throughput sequencing data to identify novel therapeutic targets in cancer.

I also enjoy traveling, playing squash, and attending hackathons.
