$logit(p) <- log(p/(1-p))$ #this is appropriately called the log odds. The "odds" are a ratio between 2 events -- the probability of the event happening (p) and not happening (1-p). We see this as p/(1-p). The odds are wrapped in a *log*arithm -- hence the *log*-odds.

It is used to transform probabilities on the open interval (0,1) to the Real number line.

The distribution of many of these mapped probability values is often assumed to have a Normal distribution. This can help in Bayesian sampling frameworks to make it more convenient to sample from the posterior distribution.

Mnemonic -- the word 'logit' is small (compared to the word logistic), and so only relative constrained interval of probabilities can be passed through the logit function.

Note that the inverse logit takes you from logit values back to probabilities. You can use either formula. $e^v /1+e^v$.
