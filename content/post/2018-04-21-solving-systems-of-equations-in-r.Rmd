```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The code shown here is derived from this video:

Imagine that we have a system of equations with 3 variables and 3 unknowns. It looks as follows:
![System of eq.](/img/syst-eq.png)

```{r}
A = array(c(3,2,-1,2,-2,0.5,-1,4,-1), dim = c(3,3))
b = c(1,-2,0)
A
x = solve(a = A, b = b)
Ax = A %*% x %>% 
  as.numeric %>% 
  round(10)

all.equal(Ax, b) #are the two equal?

invA = solve(A)
#all.equal(invA %*% b %>% as.numeric, x)
invA %*% b %>% 
  as.numeric %>% 
  all.equal(x)

```
