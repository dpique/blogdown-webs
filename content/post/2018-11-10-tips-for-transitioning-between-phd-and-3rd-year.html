<p>This post is about transitioning between graduate school and medical school in the MD-PhD program. The transition should begin early in your graduate school career. Try shadowing or taking part in a clinic, perhaps once per week, to both develop your clinical skills and also identify clinical specialties that you want to go in to. Some programs have this built in, others you may have to seek this out or set it up.</p>
<p>As a 3rd year medical student, you will have 4 major tasks: Taking a history, performing a physical exam, presenting patients to an attending, and writing a note on the patient. In brief, listening, examining, speaking, and writing.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Taking a history: SMASHED FM.</p></li>
<li><p>Presenting patients: Keep it short, fluid, and succinct. The attending will fill in or ask about any major gaps - itâ€™s okay for this to happen. Better to have a short, incomplete 1 min presentation than a 10 minute presentation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ask the person you are shadowing if you can do the history or physical alone or with them watching.</p>
<p>The one big thing is to practice your clinical presentations and note writing skills.</p>
