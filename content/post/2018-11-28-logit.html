<p>The logit is defined as <span class="math inline">\(logit(p) = log(p/(1-p))\)</span> and is also called the log odds. The “odds” are a ratio between 2 events – the probability of the event happening (p) and not happening (1-p). We see this as p/(1-p). The odds are wrapped in a <em>log</em>arithm – hence the <em>log</em>-odds.</p>
<p>The logit is used to transform probabilities from the open interval <span class="math inline">\((0,1)\)</span> to the real number line (<span class="math inline">\(-\infty, \infty\)</span>). Note that probabilities that equal exactly 0 or 1 would lead to a logit that is undefined.</p>
<p>The distribution of many of these mapped probability values is often assumed to have a Normal (Gaussian) distribution. This can help in Bayesian sampling frameworks to make it more convenient to sample from the posterior distribution.</p>
<p>Note that the inverse logit takes you from logit values (infinite domain) back to probabilities. The inverse logit is also known as the logistic function: <span class="math inline">\(logistic(v) = e^v /{1+e^v}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Mnemonic – log<strong>it</strong> has infin<strong>it</strong>e domain; logis<strong>ti</strong>c has <strong>ti</strong>ny domain (0,1)</p>
