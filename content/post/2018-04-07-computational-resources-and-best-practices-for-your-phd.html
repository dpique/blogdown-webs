<p>Below are some best practices and computational resources offered by Einstein, along with links to how you can obtain these resources. I divide these resources/best practices into essentials, for every PhD student, and useful/non-essential, which will be useful mainly for those doing computationally intensive work. Einstein’s resources are a bit spread out across multiple websites, but hopefully this list helps synthesize these different tips and resources. I also include some freely available resources not specific to Einstein but that may be helpful to students generally.</p>
<div id="essentials" class="section level2">
<h2>Essentials</h2>
<div id="backing-up-your-work" class="section level4">
<h4>1. Backing up your work</h4>
<p><strong>Where can I back up my work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can back up your work and personal computers/devices through inSync, a cloud-based back up system. Einstein offers inSync for free, and this service comes with unlimited storage, automatic backups at time intervals that you specify, and backups for up to 10 devices. Note that backed up data are kept private.</li>
<li><p>To get started with inSync, submit a ticket to the <a href="https://itsupport.einstein.yu.edu/">Einstein IT support website</a>. Note that you have to be on Einstein’s campus to access this website:</p></li>
<li>Another option is Google backup and sync (also see below): <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" class="uri">https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/</a></li>
<li><p>You don’t need to contact anyone for this, just download backup and sync and start backing up all your files to google drive (you have unlimited storage through Einstein gmail/google account)</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Maintaining a lab notebook</h4>
<p><strong>How do I organize my analyses/experiments and daily tasks?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared to spend a considerable amount of time maintaining a lab notebook. A good notebook requires sustained daily effort but can really pay off. PIs will often pay attention to your lab notebook, and it can be impressive to have a well-organized one. The lab notebook can be electronic (ELN) or paper copy, ask your PI if he/she has a preference.</li>
<li>There are several ideas good free tools and ideas related to ELNs. There’s not one solution that best fits all. I would definitely consider electronic lab notebooks (ELN), even if you’re doing experimental work. Automatic backups, accessibility from anywhere, ability to add timestamps, and shareability with your PI (or others) would be a few of the advantages of the ELN.</li>
<li>Below are a few papers/links that discuss how to set up and organize a lab notebook. Browse around, mix and match ideas, and see what works for you.</li>

<div id="reference-managers" class="section level4">
<h4>3. Reference managers</h4>
<p><strong>How do I manage my references?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley reference management</a> (free), not specific to Einstein. Use the online plug-in to add citations and download pdfs automatically while you are browsing. Makes it easy to create bibliographies and in-text citations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="useful-but-not-essential" class="section level3">
<h3>Useful, but not essential</h3>
<div id="where-can-i-store-my-large-data-files" class="section level4">
<h4>1. Where can I store my large data files?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Unlimited storage is available on your Einstein account google drive. Can store huge files on here like RNA-seq, fastq, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Dropbox Business account (Einstein) is available for employees/students with 1PB of shared storage. You can email <a href="mailto:ricardo.justiniano@einstein.yu.edu">ricardo.justiniano@einstein.yu.edu</a> and ask him to join.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="where-can-i-perform-computationally-intensive-tasks" class="section level4">
<h4>2. Where can I perform computationally intensive tasks?</h4>
<ul>
<li>On Einstein’s high performance computing (HPC) cluster. See <a href="http://dpique.rbind.io/2017/11/29/introduction-to-einstein-s-hpc-cluster/">this post</a> for more information on how to get set up.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-other-commonly-used-software-is-available-through-einstein" class="section level4">
<h4>3. What other commonly used software is available through Einstein?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The websites below list software provided by Einstein. Note that Einstein provides Microsoft Office and Adobe creative cloud, among other software, for free, so no need to purchase these. There’s also a list available through <a href="https://itsupport.einstein.yu.edu/">Einstein IT support website</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.einstein.yu.edu/research/research-computing/specialty-software-information.aspx" class="uri">https://www.einstein.yu.edu/research/research-computing/specialty-software-information.aspx</a> <a href="http://www.einstein.yu.edu/research/research-computing/computing.aspx?id=35482" class="uri">http://www.einstein.yu.edu/research/research-computing/computing.aspx?id=35482</a> <a href="http://einstein.yu.edu/departments/neuroscience/administration/maurice-volaski.aspx" class="uri">http://einstein.yu.edu/departments/neuroscience/administration/maurice-volaski.aspx</a> <a href="https://www.einstein.yu.edu/centers/cancer/default.aspx?id=52662" class="uri">https://www.einstein.yu.edu/centers/cancer/default.aspx?id=52662</a></p>
<p>Basically, keep poking around and asking until you find the resources you need. You can always submit a ticket to the IT help desk, and they are pretty responsive.</p>
<div id="how-do-i-access-the-einstein-network-from-off-campus" class="section level5">
<h5>4. How do I access the Einstein network from off campus?</h5>
<p>By using VPN. Submit a ticket through the IT support portal to get set up with this. The portal that you will need to log into is <a href="https://secureaccess.montefiore.org/vpn/index.html">here</a>.</p>
