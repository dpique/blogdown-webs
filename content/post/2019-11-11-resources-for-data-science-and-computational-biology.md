How do I learn about data science and computational biology?
Below are some free resources that I have found useful related to data science, data visualization, and computational biology. These mostly pertain to the R environment.


### Newsletters and Blogs

1. Subscribe to [Monday morning data science (MMDS)](http://jhudatascience.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5ea551600fcdf84334e5aa6b0&id=26c0b7221a) - weekly newsletter with updates on R and data science news and resources

1. Subscribe to [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) as a way to learn about new tools

1. The [Simply statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/) blog has updates from leading academic data scientists


### Research workflow - best practices

1. [Cookie cutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#other-people-will-thank-you) - provides template for data science project file structure

  - there are [other](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/) [opinions](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html)/[examples](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/06/research-workflow.html) on how to do this. Might be best to pick one and then organize this the same way for all your projects. Even better if you use a R package that can create this project structure automatically, like [workflowR](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/).

1. [Peerj - practical data science](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/). This is a collection of articles that discuss best practices for data collection and analysis.


### Courses

1. Audit this series of courses: [Data science specialization on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/home/welcome)

1. Take the [Stanford edX course on statistical learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about). Very comprehensive - includes videos, a free book, and R code examples.

1. An understanding of statistics (e.g. linear models, dimensionality reduction, permutations) and linear algebra help with doing computational biology. Essential linear algebra and statistics are offered by [this course](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences). Knowing the basics of calculus is also helpful. 

1. A [sequence of courses](https://www.edx.org/xseries/genomics-data-analysis) offered by Rafa Irizarry on edX in R for genomics

1. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). A comprehensive guide to how to do data science. Covers everything from data import to statistical modeling, visualization, and communication of results. Provides both the big picture and details through worked examples. Explains "tidyverse" principles. Only downside is there's not a focus on life sciences.


### Genomics databases

1. Genomics databases available online - there's a wealth of knowledge out there. Wikipedia [has a good list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases), and [so does CSHL](https://cshl.libguides.com/c.php?g=523983&p=3582517).


### Twitter
  
1. [#hiddencurriculum hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thehauer/status/1021179403680862218) - discusses insights into graduate school that people wish they knew when they started.
  
1. Follow Hadley Wickham, Jeff Leek, Roger Peng on Twitter.


### Data visualization

1. [Policyvis](https://policyviz.com/helpmeviz/how-it-works/) for data visualization help.

1. [Data-to-vis](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) is a guide for picking the best graph for your data.
  
1. [Data viz course in D3](https://curran.github.io/dataviz-course-2018/) - combination of youtube lectures and worked examples in [Vizhub](https://vizhub.com/) (kind of like Github, but provides an online HTMl editor for D3 and SVG). Some worked examples come from this excellent free online javascript book, [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).  
  
1. [Fundamentals of data visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) - free online book by Clause O. Wilke.

1. [Data visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/index.html#preface) - free online book by Kieran Healy. 
  
### Examples of data visualization

1. Very nice visualization of [cave rescue](https://multimedia.scmp.com/news/world/article/2154457/thai-cave-rescue/index.html)

1. [Flowing data](http://flowingdata.com/) is a collection of data visualization and data journalism.

1. [Pudding.cool](https://pudding.cool/) has well-illustrated and interesting data essays 

1. [Visual cinnamon](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/) has excellent examples of data visualization

1. Look at the winners from data visualization contests like [malofiej](http://www.malofiejgraphics.com/) and the [information is beautiful](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?award=2016&pcategory=winner&type=awards) awards

### Other

1. Sign up for a local hackathon. If there are none in your neighborhood, join one online. 

1. Contribute to an open-source project. Here's [a guide for how to get started](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

1. [Cheatsheets offered by RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

1. A cheatsheet for [statistical tests and their equivalent linear models in R](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)

### Resources specific to Einstein

1. [Dissertation database](http://libcat.einstein.yu.edu/search/a?searchtype=Y&searcharg=dissertations+and+theses&SORT=D&searchscope=1&submit=Search) - click on the first link. For an example of a well-organized thesis, search for Shira Rockowitz, student of Deyou Zheng, at Einstein.
